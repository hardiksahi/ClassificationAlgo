# ClassificationAlgorithms
This repository contains code for classification algorithms namely Perceptron and Winnow.
They are simple linear classfication algorithms.
Perceptron forms the basic component of neural networks which has an additive weight update algoritm.
Winnow is another linear classifier which has a multiplicative wight update algorithm

Dataset used: Spambase dataset
